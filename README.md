# CryIndigoVR
This will House the Code for Cryengine VR. I do not own anything CryEngine related. Only the component code provided was developed by IndigoAffect LLC. 

To get started download the project as a zip file and unzip it. 

Also Download the Custom VR CryEngine from OneDrive. [In the future it will be on GitHub too](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah4k-gNkBMHTjahUQF-R2edxQf10nA?e=sqilQb):  

Once this is done follow the Oculus tutorial on Youtube! 

There will be an OpenVR and Flowgraph tutorial in the coming days!

I do not own CryEngine or anything related to it. I have simply updated its VR code and added my own to it. For the original CryEngine code, please visit their GitHub.
