# CryIndigoVR
This will House the Code for Cryengine VR. I do not own anything CryEngine related. Only the component code provided was developed by IndigoAffect LLC. 

To get started download the project as a zip file. Unzip both the repository and CRYENGINE-VRUpdated

Once this is done follow the Oculus tutorial on Youtube!

I do not own CryEngine or anything related to it. I have simply updated its VR code and added my own to it. For the original CryEngine code, please visit their GitHub.
